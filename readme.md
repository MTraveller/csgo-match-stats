This app was made using Vitejs, React, and Chakra-ui and was written with TypeScript. Unfortunately, there maybe be an issue here or there as I am new to Chakra-ui, reactQuerym hook-form, zustang and zod. I got much to learn and this tiny project was part of my learning journey that I am excited about.

App should be fully mobile responsive.

Thanks for visiting :)
