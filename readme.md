# CS:GO Match Server Log Stats Viewer

To run on your machine:
`npm i` && `npm run dev`

This app was made using Vitejs, React, and Chakra-ui and was written with TypeScript. Unfortunately, it is not mobile-responsive as I am new to Chakra-ui and still have much to learn about it.

Known bugs: entering a broken url returns 404 and the app needs to be reloaded.
