# CS:GO Match Server Log Stats Viewer

Check it out! I made this app with TypeScript, Vitejs, React, and Chakra-ui! ðŸš€

Itâ€™s official: Iâ€™ve fallen in love with TypeScript. Itâ€™s awesome - it catches most errors and makes coding faster and easier once you get the hang of it.

I gotta admit, there might be a hiccup or two because I'm still getting the hang of Chakra-ui, reactQuery, hook-form, zustang, zod and most importantly - TypeScript. But hey, every mistake is a lesson learned, right? ðŸ˜‰

The app is mobile responsive! So you can take it with you wherever you go. ðŸ“±

To run on your machine:

First install git if it doesn't exist on your computer.

Then in the terminal: git clone https://github.com/MTraveller/csgo-match-stats.git

`npm i` && `npm run dev`, additional commands ->

- `npm run build`: Builds into ./dist folder
- `npm run lint`: checks code with eslint
- `npm run test`: run tests with jest
- `npm run preview`: runs a production build
